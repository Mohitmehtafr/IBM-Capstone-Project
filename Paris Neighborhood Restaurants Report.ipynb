But Paris, being a big city could be perplexing to choose the right area and also the right cuisine. So by leveraging the power of data science I am going to help him answer in which area should he open his restaurant and of which cuisine?\n\nI will answer the following 3 questions: \n\n1> What is the geographic distribution of the restaurants in Paris which could help us to find which area is least served?\n\n2> Which restaurant cuisines dominate which areas giving us insights on which cuisine restaurant should we open?\n\n3> Try to see if there is any pattern emerging in our restaurants' data? (for this I have used machine learning algorithm - KNN) \n\nBesides this we will also analyze Paris from the standpoint of population, population density to give an idea of the demand of the restaurant in a neighborhood. \n\n",

In Paris every arrondisement has a name, but more poplularly, arrondisements are called by numbers. say \"Eiffel tower is in 7th arrondisement\". \n\nThe wikipedia data did not have the geolocation data, so I  used Nominatim library to generate the geocordiantes. \n\nFurther, for each arrondisement, I pulled the restaurants data from Foursquare API. The geolocation data of the restaurant and the type of cuisine. Foursquare returns the top 100 listings for a given geolocation point. For example, when I send data (2.338028 \t48.861147) longitude & latitude of arrondisement 1, Foursquare returns the top 100 restaurants in that region within a radius of 2.5Km. \n ",
